Objectives
Select or create a dataset and practice applying Râ€™s generic functions.
Learn to identify and work with S3 and S4 object systems.
Document your findings and examples on your blog and GitHub.

Tasks
Choose or Download Data
Load an existing dataset (e.g., data("mtcars")) or download/create your own.
Show the first few rows with head() and describe its structure with str().

Test Generic Functions
Pick one or more base generic functions (e.g., print(), summary(), plot()).
Apply them to your dataset or an object derived from it.

If a generic does *not* dispatch on your object, explain *why* (e.g., no method defined for that class).
Explore S3 vs. S4
Create an S3 object example
Create an S4 class and object
Install Packages: install.packages("pryr")
