#Assignment 2
#Evaluate myMean Function
#Use the vector:
#assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
#Consider this function:
#myMean <- function(assignment2) {
#return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
# }
#In RStudio, run myMean(assignment2) and record the output or error.
